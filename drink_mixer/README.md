# Drink Mixer 5000 V1.0

## OverView of the project:

The idea behind this project is to create a drink mixer using a Pi and a series of peristaltic pumps. This setup uses python scripts linked to buttons on a webpage that allow you to click on a button and produce a drink based on it's contents. Pours are done based on a sleep command and how long it takes to output a certain amount of liquid. It is a little on the slow side at dispencing liquid but very accurate, which in my mind means more. 

Bottles:
* Contain the scripts for pumping from bottles based on amount given

Templates: 
* Contain the templates used to make the Bottles scripts

Single_amounts:
* Contain individual scripts to run pour an oz, 0.5oz, 2oz, and 1.5oz liquid.
